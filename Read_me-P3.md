#### Introduction to Project

The Airbnb Analysis project focuses on analyzing Airbnb data from the travel industry and property management domain. By leveraging SQL PG admin and various data analysis and visualization tools, we aim to extract valuable insights into pricing dynamics, availability patterns, and location-based trends in Airbnb listings.
Tourism Impact Assessment in Hawaii - Koloa-Poipu

####  Objective:
The primary goal of this data analysis project is to assess the impact of tourism on the Hawaii - Koloa-Poipu region. We selected this location because it is the highest rated area within Hawaii. By analyzing various data sources, we aim to understand the patterns, trends, and economic implications of tourism in the area.

#### Key Components: 
Gather data on the demographics of tourists visiting Hawaii - Koloa-Poipu.
Analyze seasonal fluctuations, average price, and rating 

#### Seasonal Trends:
Explore seasonal variations in bookings and prices
Identify peak tourist seasons and potential factors influencing these patterns.


### Objectives

The primary objectives of this project include:

1. Establishing a connection to SQL PG admin and retrieving the Airbnb dataset efficiently.
2. Cleaning and preparing the dataset to ensure data integrity and consistency.
3. Developed with Python geo.json API visualizations.
4. Analyzing and visualizing pricing variations based on location, and property type, in Kauai.
5. Examining availability patterns and demand fluctuations across seasons.
6. Investigating location-based insights for Kauai.
7. Creating interactive visualizations for user exploration.

### Data Source

The project utilizes SQL, PG admin, SQLite, as the data source, containing sample Airbnb data. The data includes information about listings, hosts, neighborhoods, pricing, ratings, and more.

## 2. Methodology

### SQL Connection and Data Retrieval

We established a connection to SQL and retrieved the Airbnb dataset. Data retrieval operations were performed to extract the necessary information for analysis. We ethically sourced our data by using public records and resources for retrieval.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

The dataset underwent a comprehensive data cleaning and preparation process. This involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting data types for accurate analysis. The dataset was made ready for exploratory data analysis and visualization tasks using the following libraries: pandas, html, matplotlib, Pyplot, seaborn, and numPy.
 

### Geospatial Visualization using Topographic map

We developed a street view and topographic map web application that utilizes geospatial data from the Airbnb dataset. Interactive maps were created to visualize the distribution of Airbnb listings across different locations, allowing users to explore prices, ratings, and other relevant factors.

### Price Analysis and Visualization

Using the cleaned data, we conducted a thorough analysis of how prices vary across different neighborhoods, property types, and seasons. Dynamic plots and charts were created to enable users to explore price trends, outliers, and correlations with other variables.

### Availability Analysis by Season

We analyzed the availability of Airbnb listings based on seasonal variations. Occupancy rates, booking patterns, and demand fluctuations throughout the year were visualized using bar charts.

### Location-Based Insights

We investigated how the price of listings varies across Kaui. Utilizing SQL queries and data aggregation techniques were used to extract relevant information for specific regions and neighborhoods in Kaui. These insights were visualized on interactive maps using tools like javascript.

### Interactive Visualizations

Dynamic and interactive visualizations enable users to interact with specific regions, property types, or areas of interest.

### Dashboard Creation using Tableau or Power BI

* A comprehensive dashboard was built using Tableau or Power BI, combining various visualizations to present key insights from the analysis. This dashboard provided a holistic view of the Airbnb dataset and its patterns.

## 3. Data Analysis and Findings

### Pricing Trends

The analysis revealed significant pricing variations based on neighborhood, property type, and average price per rating range. Interactive visualizations showcased these trends, enabling users to explore and understand price dynamics.

### Availability Patterns

Availability patterns were analyzed, indicating occupancy rates and demand fluctuations across seasons. Visualizations allowed for a deep dive into booking patterns.

### Location-Based Insights

Location-based insights highlighted price disparities in specific regions or neighborhoods. Users could explore these insights interactively.

## 4. Conclusion

### Summary of Insights

In conclusion, the Airbnb Analysis project successfully provided valuable insights into pricing variations, availability patterns, and location-based trends within the Airbnb dataset. * Key findings included...

### Key Takeaways

The project facilitated learning outcomes in SQL-PG Admin, Seaborn, Python data analysis, geospatial analysis, and data visualization techniques. It enhanced problem-solving and data-driven decision-making skills.
