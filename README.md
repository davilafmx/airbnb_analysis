### Data Source

<<<<<<< HEAD
The project utilizes —--SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc—. as the data source, containing sample Airbnb data. The data includes information about listings, hosts, neighborhoods, pricing, ratings, and more.

## 2. Methodology

### MongoDB Connection and Data Retrieval

We established a connection to MongoDB Atlas and retrieved the Airbnb dataset. MongoDB queries and data retrieval operations were performed to extract the necessary information for analysis.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

The dataset underwent a comprehensive data cleaning and preparation process. This involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting data types for accurate analysis. The dataset was made ready for exploratory data analysis and visualization tasks.

### Geospatial Visualization using Streamlit

We developed a Streamlined web application that utilizes geospatial data from the Airbnb dataset. Interactive maps were created to visualize the distribution of Airbnb listings across different locations, allowing users to explore prices, ratings, and other relevant factors.

### Price Analysis and Visualization

Using the cleaned data, we conducted a thorough analysis of how prices vary across different locations, property types, and seasons. Dynamic plots and charts were created to enable users to explore price trends, outliers, and correlations with other variables.

## 2. Methodology

### SQL Connection and Data Retrieval

We established a connection to SQL and retrieved the Airbnb dataset. Data retrieval operations were performed to extract the necessary information for analysis. We ehtically sourced our data by using public records and resources for retreival.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

The dataset underwent a comprehensive data cleaning and preparation process. This involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting data types for accurate analysis. The dataset was made ready for exploratory data analysis and visualization tasks using the following libraries: pandas, html, matplot, pyplot and nympy.
 

### Geospatial Visualization using Topographic map

We developed a street view and topographic map web application that utilizes geospatial data from the Airbnb dataset. Interactive maps were created to visualize the distribution of Airbnb listings across different locations, allowing users to explore prices, ratings, and other relevant factors.

### Price Analysis and Visualization

Using the cleaned data, we conducted a thorough analysis of how prices vary across different neighborhoods, property types, and seasons. Dynamic plots and charts were created to enable users to explore price trends, outliers, and correlations with other variables.

### Availability Analysis by Season

We analyzed the availability of Airbnb listings based on seasonal variations. Occupancy rates, booking patterns, and demand fluctuations throughout the year were visualized using line charts, heatmaps, or other suitable visualizations.

### Location-Based Insights

<<<<<<< HEAD
We investigated how the price of listings varies across different locations. MongoDB queries and data aggregation techniques were used to extract relevant information for specific regions or neighborhoods. These insights were visualized on interactive maps or created dashboards in tools like Tableau or Power BI.
